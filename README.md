# projectEuler
These are my solutions (some in Java, some in Python) to the problems of Project Eurler ( https://projecteuler.net/archives )

I studied Accouting and Finance but my passions are programming and AI, so I started my career as a programmer in October 2018, when I launched my first app (Wordee) for Android, using Java.

Since I want to improve my programming skills (specially in C, Java and Python) and feel more comfortable with algorithms, I decided to start solving the Project Euler's problems (no libraries).
